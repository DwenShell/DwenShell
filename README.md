Hi 👋 My name is Clara Giraud
=============================

Unity C# Junior Developper and Unreal Blueprint Junior Developper
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently in Bachelor oriented Video Game, I have been interested since I was 10 years old in everything that has a microcontroller. Unable to become a cyborg, I reoriented myself on programming. For 4 years I mainly focus on Unity as well as Unreal Engine. Always looking for new projects, these help me improve my skills day after day. My studies also allow me to understand the general workflow of a game studio and therefore the different stages of production. (It doesn't look like, but sometimes I also do 3D)

*   🌍  I'm based in Laval, FRANCE
*   🖥️  See my portfolio at [My Website](http://dwenshell.github.io/)
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [contact.claragiraud@gmail.com](mailto:contact.claragiraud@gmail.com)
*   🚀  I'm currently working on [Nina & Yuri](http://dwenshell.github.io/Nina-et-Yuri-EN/)
*   🧠  I'm learning the basics of C++ and the subtleties of C#
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on projects oriented for research or small independent games.
*   ⚡  One day I will know the difference between a good and a bad developer; in the meantime I am content with the middle.
